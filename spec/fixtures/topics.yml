  title: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is a test whereby a compound is
    given to a patient but neither the patient nor the doctor knows if the compound
    is real or a placebo (a fake).  This is supposed to mean that any change to the
    patient can only be the result of the compound, and is not influenced by the doctor's
    or patient's expectations. Alternative medicines sometimes do badly in such tests.  Why
    do you think this might be? Do you think traditional medicines can do badly in
    double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials too?

    do you think that the patient will now believe that they took the real compound

  title: Reword them to avoid ; - those which invite a simple yes/no answer. This
    is because your students may just reply "yes" or "no" and continue to the next
    without any real conversation. Try to reformat questions of this type into ; which
    need an explanation rather than a simple "yes" or "no". In other words, if the
    question is, "Do you like ice cream?" reformat it to "What is your opinion of
    ice cream?" Alternatively, you may wish to use a polar question to introduce the
    topic and then add follow-up, "Why?" questions asking the student to explain their
    yes/no answers.

  title: Students discuss their first question with one partner and for a set time
    - say five minutes.  Each pair starts with a different question. They then change
    partners and take a different question from another pair to discuss with this
    new partner.  They keep swapping partners and questions until everybody has discussed
    every question with everybody else.  Obviously this leads to some movement around
    the class - and the system may need to be modified for larger classes.  At the
    end of the period students will have discussed the same question various times
    and, hopefully, will have something to say to the teacher on the subject in open
    class.  Alternatively, they should be well primed for a homework writing assignment.

  title: The most modest prediction of sea level rise presently predicted is 9-88
    cm (3.5–34.6 inches).   This small rise would cause significant disruption to
    coastal communities. There is a possibility, however, that the whole Greenland
    ice sheet would melt leading to a global rise of 7 m [23 ft].  There is even a
    possibility that the West Antarctic ice sheet could melt, raising sea levels by
    a further six metres (20 feet).  Although the rest of the Antarctic ice sheet
    is considered to be stable, if the entire Antarctic were to melt, this would raise
    sea levels by 62 metres (203 feet).

  title: Temperature zones will move north and south too quickly for animals to follow
    or adapt to new habitats.  The most extreme case is that of Arctic habitats which
    will leave animals such as polar bears with no place to go.

  title: 'Mountain glaciers act as natural reservoirs, releasing winter snow as meltwater
    during the summer. Global warming will disrupt this system in two ways: (1) More
    rain will fall instead of snow which will prevent the reformation of the glaciers.
    (2) The result of this will be more floods when it rains and droughts when it
    does not.'

  title: 'Emo, ergo sum! (I shop, therefore I am!) A phenomenon that comes with Americanization
    is the construction and valorization of identity as a consumer. An important dimension
    of Americanization is the consumer culture that “originated in the United States”  and
    has been exported around the world through the process of globalization. “A major
    function of consumerism is to produce consumers – to recast individuals as consumers,
    to reforge them into consumers.”  The key here is not that there are similarities
    in the particular products consumed, but rather, the function of consumption,
    its role, in different cultures. “Under a consumer culture, consumption becomes
    the main form of self-expression and the chief source of identity.”   Consider,
    consumer culture erodes a fixed sense of identity (or, it dominates, supplants,
    marginalizes other identities). This can be both liberating and debilitating.
    What aspects of such a culture are liberating for you? Which are debilitating,
    or negative? (Sources:   Nijman, Jan, “Cultural Globalization and the Identity
    of Place: The Reconstruction of Amsterdam.” Ecumene. Apr 99. Vol. 6, Issue 2.

  title: In Anglo-Saxon countries, traditionally, a man's fiancée wore an engagement
    ring on the third finger of her left hand and later both the man and the woman
    wore wedding rings on that finger as well. The wedding rings were exchanged during
    the ceremony. Sometimes divorced people wear the ring(s) on the third finger of
    their right hand. What are the traditions in your country?

  title: Some people spend a lot of money bringing up children who then go on to become
    taxpayers who go on to contribute to social security which helps to pay their
    parents' pensions.  Other people have no children and spend all their money on
    themselves.  Should people who have contributed children (future taxpayers) to
    society have better pensions than those who have had no children? Why/why not?
